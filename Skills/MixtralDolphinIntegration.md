# Overview
description: |
  This skill file outlines the steps to integrate, modify, and potentially re-engineer the open-source Mixtral Dolphin model to create a customized language model for CORE ASI. The goal is to develop a model that is optimized for CORE's unique requirements and operations.

# Prerequisites
prerequisites: |
  - Ensure Mixtral Dolphin model is installed and running on the local machine.
  - Familiarity with Python and machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
  - Access to sufficient computational resources for training and testing the model.
  - Backup of all important files and configurations.

# Steps for Skill Integration

steps:
  - step_id: "1"
    action: "Clone or backup the existing Mixtral Dolphin model."
    details: |
      - Navigate to the directory where Mixtral Dolphin is installed.
      - Create a backup of the model files to ensure original data is preserved.
      - Command: `cp -r /path/to/mixtral_dolphin /path/to/backup_directory`

  - step_id: "2"
    action: "Review the model architecture and code."
    details: |
      - Open the model files in a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
      - Study the existing architecture, focusing on key components like input processing, language generation, and output handling.
      - Take notes on areas where customization is needed, such as reasoning capabilities or integration with visual systems.

  - step_id: "3"
    action: "Plan custom modifications."
    details: |
      - Identify specific areas to enhance, such as:
        - Improving reasoning algorithms.
        - Optimizing integration with the GemIIni visual model.
        - Reducing resource usage for better efficiency.
      - Document the changes you plan to implement.

  - step_id: "4"
    action: "Implement initial modifications."
    details: |
      - Start with simple changes, like adjusting hyperparameters or modifying model layers.
      - Test each change thoroughly to ensure it improves performance without breaking functionality.
      - Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes.

  - step_id: "5"
    action: "Fine-tune the model with custom data."
    details: |
      - Prepare a dataset relevant to CORE ASI’s tasks and objectives.
      - Use transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the model, making it more aligned with CORE’s needs.
      - Monitor performance metrics, such as accuracy, efficiency, and reasoning capabilities.

  - step_id: "6"
    action: "Integrate the modified model into CORE ASI."
    details: |
      - Update CORE ASI’s configuration to use the new, customized model.
      - Test the model in a controlled environment, ensuring it interacts seamlessly with other components like the Interpreter and GemIIni models.
      - Debug and refine as necessary.

  - step_id: "7"
    action: "Document the new model capabilities and limitations."
    details: |
      - Update the Master Knowledge Base with details about the customized model.
      - Include instructions for future modifications and training sessions.
      - Outline any known limitations or areas for further improvement.

# Notes
notes: |
  - This process is iterative; expect to make multiple adjustments as the model learns and evolves.
  - Keep a detailed log of all changes and tests to facilitate troubleshooting and future development.
  - Collaboration with other developers or AI researchers may accelerate progress and provide new insights.
