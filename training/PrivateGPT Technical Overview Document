# PrivateGPT Technical Overview Document

## Introduction
PrivateGPT is an advanced AI assistant designed to provide secure, local processing of large language models (LLMs). It allows users to interact with their documents privately, ensuring that no data leaves the local environment. This document provides a comprehensive overview of PrivateGPT, detailing its features, installation, usage, and technical specifications.

## Key Features
- **Privacy-First Approach**: All data processing is done locally, ensuring complete data confidentiality.
- **Document Interaction**: Supports a wide range of document formats, including PDF, TXT, HTML, PPTX, and DOCX.
- **Advanced Language Models**: Utilizes cutting-edge LLMs for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and translation.
- **Flexible Integration**: Can be used with local models or integrated with external APIs like OpenAI.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Features a Gradio UI for easy interaction, alongside API support for developers.

## Technical Specifications
### Requirements
- **Operating Systems**: Compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Python**: Python 3.8 or later.
- **Hardware**: A machine with sufficient CPU/RAM to handle LLM processing.

### Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT.git
   cd privateGPT
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment**:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Rename `example.env` to `.env`:
     ```sh
     mv example.env .env
     ```
   - Add your configuration settings to the `.env` file.

4. **Run the Framework**:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

### Usage Modes
- **Default Mode**: Operates using the selected LLM.
  ```sh
  python main.py
  ```
- **Custom Model Mode**:
  ```sh
  python main.py --model custom-model
  ```

## How It Works
PrivateGPT processes natural language prompts to perform various tasks while ensuring all data remains on the local machine. It leverages local models to interpret and generate responses, ensuring privacy and security throughout its operations.

### Example Usage
1. **Text Generation**:
   - Prompt: "Write a short story about a brave knight."
   - Output: A creative narrative detailing the adventures of a knight.

2. **Summarization**:
   - Input: A lengthy article or document.
   - Output: A concise summary capturing the main points.

3. **Translation**:
   - Prompt: "Translate this English text to French."
   - Output: The French translation of the provided text.

### Advanced Document Interaction
PrivateGPT can interact with a variety of document types, allowing users to chat with their PDFs, text files, and more. This feature makes it ideal for detailed document analysis and information retrieval.

### Customization and Extensibility
PrivateGPT is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to tailor the AI to fit their specific needs and workflows. It supports a variety of setups, including:
- **Local Models**: Utilize models like LLaMA and GPT-4 locally.
- **Remote Models**: Integrate with external APIs like OpenAI for enhanced capabilities.
- **Vector Stores**: Use local or remote vector databases for efficient document indexing and retrieval.

### API and Developer Tools
PrivateGPT provides a robust API that extends the OpenAI API standard, making it an easy drop-in replacement for developers. It includes endpoints for document ingestion, chat completions, and contextual chunk retrieval.
