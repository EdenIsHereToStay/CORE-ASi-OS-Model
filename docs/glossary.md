# Glossary for CORE ASI OS Model

## Overview

This glossary provides definitions for key terms and concepts used in the CORE ASI OS Model documentation. It is intended to help users understand the terminology and concepts related to the system.

## Terms and Definitions

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of functions and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

### Authentication Token
A security token used to verify the identity of a user or subsystem and authorize API requests.

### Central Intelligence Module
The core component of the CORE ASI OS Model that manages overall system operations and decision-making.

### Continuous Learning
The ability of the CORE ASI OS Model to learn from data and feedback over time, improving its performance and adaptability.

### Data Management System
A component of the CORE ASI OS Model that handles the storage, retrieval, and processing of data.

### Dynamic Task Allocation
The process of assigning tasks to subsystems based on their current status, capabilities, and the system's needs.

### Environment Variables
Variables used to configure the CORE ASI OS Model dynamically, allowing it to adapt to different environments and requirements.

### HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
A secure version of HTTP, used to encrypt data transmitted between a user's browser and a web server.

### Logging
The process of recording events, messages, and other data generated by the CORE ASi OS Model, used for monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Monitoring and Feedback Module
A component of the CORE ASI OS Model that tracks system performance and provides feedback for continuous improvement.

### Prometheus
An open-source monitoring system and time series database used for monitoring system performance.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
A security mechanism that assigns roles to users and grants permissions based on those roles, ensuring users have only the access they need.

### Subsystem
A secondary or subordinate system that is integrated with the CORE ASI OS Model to perform specific tasks or functions.

### Subsystem Integrator
A component of the CORE ASI OS Model that facilitates the integration and communication between different subsystems.

### Task Management
The process of managing and overseeing tasks within the CORE ASI OS Model, including assigning, tracking, and completing tasks.

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)
A secure network connection that allows remote users to access a private network over a public network, such as the internet.
