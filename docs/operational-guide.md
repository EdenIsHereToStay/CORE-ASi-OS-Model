# Operational Guide for CORE ASI OS Model

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for system administrators on managing and maintaining the CORE ASI OS Model in a production environment. It includes information on monitoring, logging, backup and recovery, and system maintenance.

## Monitoring

### Setting Up Monitoring Tools

CORE ASI OS Model integrates with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.

1. **Install Prometheus**:
   - Follow the [Prometheus Installation Guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/) to install Prometheus on your system.

2. **Install Grafana**:
   - Follow the [Grafana Installation Guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/) to install Grafana.

3. **Configure Prometheus**:
   - Add the CORE ASI OS Model as a target in the Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`).

   Example `prometheus.yml`:

   ```yaml
   global:
     scrape_interval: 15s
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'core-asi-os'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['localhost:9090']
   ```

4. **Set Up Grafana Dashboard**:
   - Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana and create dashboards to visualize metrics.

## Logging

### Accessing Logs

Logs provide valuable insights into the system's operation and help in troubleshooting issues.

1. **Docker Logs**:
   - Use the following command to view logs of a specific Docker container:

   ```
   docker logs <container_id>
   ```

2. **Centralized Logging**:
   - Set up a centralized logging system using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) or Fluentd.

### Log Rotation

To prevent log files from consuming too much disk space, set up log rotation.

1. **Logrotate**:
   - Install and configure Logrotate to manage log rotation.

   Example configuration (`/etc/logrotate.d/docker`):

   ```plaintext
   /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log {
     rotate 7
     daily
     compress
     missingok
     delaycompress
     copytruncate
   }
   ```

## Backup and Recovery

### Regular Backups

Perform regular backups of critical data to ensure data integrity and availability.

1. **Database Backups**:
   - Use the following command to back up the PostgreSQL database:

   ```
   pg_dump -U coreuser -h localhost coredb > coredb_backup.sql
   ```

2. **File System Backups**:
   - Use `rsync` or a similar tool to back up important files and directories.

   ```
   rsync -avz /path/to/data /path/to/backup
   ```

### Recovery Process

In case of a failure, follow these steps to restore the system from backups.

1. **Restore Database**:
   - Use the following command to restore the PostgreSQL database from a backup file:

   ```
   psql -U coreuser -h localhost coredb < coredb_backup.sql
   ```

2. **Restore Files**:
   - Use `rsync` to restore files from the backup location.

   ```
   rsync -avz /path/to/backup /path/to/data
   ```

## System Maintenance

### Regular Updates

Keep the system and its dependencies up to date to ensure security and stability.

1. **Update Docker Images**:
   - Pull the latest Docker images and restart the containers.

   ```
   docker-compose pull
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Update Application**:
   - Pull the latest changes from the repository and rebuild the Docker images.

   ```
   git pull origin main
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Performance Tuning

Optimize system performance by adjusting configuration parameters and monitoring resource usage.

1. **Database Tuning**:
   - Adjust PostgreSQL configuration parameters for optimal performance.

   Example configuration (`postgresql.conf`):

   ```plaintext
   shared_buffers = 256MB
   work_mem = 64MB
   maintenance_work_mem = 128MB
   ```

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage, and adjust Docker resource limits as needed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while managing the system, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting-guide.md) for solutions to common problems.
