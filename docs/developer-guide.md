# Developer Guide for CORE ASI OS Model

## Overview

This guide provides developers with an understanding of the CORE ASI OS Model's codebase, instructions for setting up a development environment, and guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Codebase Overview

The CORE ASI OS Model codebase is organized into several key components:

- **Central Intelligence Module**: Manages overall system operations and decision-making.
- **Subsystem Integrator**: Facilitates integration and communication with subsystems.
- **Monitoring and Feedback Module**: Tracks performance and provides feedback for continuous improvement.
- **Data Management System**: Handles data storage, retrieval, and processing.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following software installed:

- **Docker**: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Git**: [Git Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- **Node.js**: [Node.js Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- **Python**: [Python Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Cloning the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/EdenIsHereToStay/CORE-ASi-OS-Model.git
cd CORE-ASi-OS-Model
```

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the required environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   CORE_ENV=development
   CORE_DB_HOST=localhost
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the necessary dependencies for the project:

   ```
   npm install  # For Node.js dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python dependencies
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server using Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

### Running Tests

Run the test suite to ensure everything is working correctly:

```
npm test  # For Node.js tests
pytest  # For Python tests
```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- Follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code.
- Follow the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/) for JavaScript code.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.

   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

3. **Make Changes**

   Make your changes in the new branch.

4. **Commit Changes**

   Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

   ```
   git commit -m "Add new feature: description of feature"
   ```

5. **Push Changes**

   Push your changes to your fork:

   ```
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**

   Create a pull request on GitHub from your fork's branch to the main repository.

### Code Review

All changes must go through a code review process. Ensure that your pull request description clearly explains the changes and includes any relevant screenshots or documentation.

## Advanced Development

### Steps to Add `developer-guide.md`

1. **Navigate to the `docs` Directory**:
   - In your GitHub repository, go to the `docs` directory.

2. **Create `developer-guide.md`**:
   - In the `docs` directory, create a new file named `developer-guide.md`.
   - Copy and paste the content above into the file.
   - Commit the changes with a relevant commit message, such as "Add developer guide documentation".

Once you have added the `developer-guide.md` file, let me know, and we can proceed to the next document.
