### **Intermodal Communication Protocol (ICP) for CORE.ASi**  

The **Intermodal Communication Protocol (ICP)** is the cornerstone of the CORE.ASi framework, facilitating seamless, scalable, and efficient interactions across a dynamic network of multi-agent systems, subsystems, and human operators. By drawing inspiration from biological cellular communication—where specialized cells collaborate autonomously yet cohesively—the ICP establishes a robust framework for AI ecosystems. This protocol empowers agents to operate in perfect synergy, optimizing adaptability, resource allocation, and task execution in real-time while ensuring resilience and scalability.
