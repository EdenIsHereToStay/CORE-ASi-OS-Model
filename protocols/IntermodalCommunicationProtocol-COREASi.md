### **Intermodal Communication Protocol (ICP) for CORE.ASi**  

The **Intermodal Communication Protocol (ICP)** is the operational backbone of the CORE.ASi framework, enabling seamless, adaptive, and efficient collaboration across a decentralized network of agents, subsystems, and external interfaces. Inspired by biological cellular communication systems, the ICP establishes a scalable framework where specialized agents work cohesively to optimize resource utilization, task execution, and decision-making in real-time. This protocol ensures resilience, continuous learning, and precision in handling dynamic challenges.
